Swagger may cause confusion. A persim berry might help with that

## TODO

- [x] Load yml files as a dict
- [ ] Add `globals` where they belong
    - [ ] request_headers
    - [ ] response_headers
    - [x] responses
- [x] Add `vars` where they belong
- [ ] Sort the parsed dict
- [x] Render the parsed dict to markdown
- [x] Write it to something
