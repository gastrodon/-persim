# Persim
A tool for generating HTTP/REST docs in Markdown from Yaml

Swagger may cause confusion. A persim berry might help with that

## TODO

- [x] Load yml files as a dict
- [ ] Add `globals` where they belong
- [x] Add `vars` where they belong
- [ ] Render the parsed dict to markdown
- [ ] Write it to something
